# Global Layoffs Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a dataset containing information about layoffs from companies around the world. The data cleaning process was performed using MySQL.

## Key Steps

1. **Duplicate Removal**
   - Created a staging table with an additional 'row_num' column
   - Used ROW_NUMBER() function to identify and remove duplicates

2. **Data Standardization**
   - Trimmed leading and trailing spaces from company names
   - Standardized industry names (e.g., unified 'Crypto' and 'Cryptocurrency')
   - Corrected country names (removed trailing periods)

3. **Date Formatting**
   - Converted date strings to proper DATE format
   - Handled multiple date formats using CASE statements

4. **Handling Null and Blank Values**
   - Identified and filled null values in the industry column
   - Used self-join technique to populate missing industry data

5. **Column Management**
   - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., 'row_num')
   - Deleted rows with null values in critical columns

## Skills Demonstrated
- MySQL data manipulation
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER())
- String functions (TRIM, LIKE)
- Date conversion (STR_TO_DATE)
- Table alterations (ALTER TABLE)
- Self-joins for data population

## Outcome
The resulting clean dataset is now ready for exploratory data analysis, providing a solid foundation for insights into global layoff trends.
