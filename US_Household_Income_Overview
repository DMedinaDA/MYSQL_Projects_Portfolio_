This project involves cleaning and analyzing US household income data, focusing on data extraction, transformation, 
and exploratory analysis to uncover insights related to household income across various states and types of areas.

***Key Findings ***
States with larger land masses tend to have higher average incomes.
Urban areas often report lower median incomes compared to suburban areas.
The analysis identified several cities with exceptionally high average household incomes, indicating localized wealth concentrations.

Standardizing State Names:***
Corrected inconsistencies in state names (e.g., changing 'georia' to 'Georgia').

Handling Missing Values:***
Addressed missing values in land and water area metrics.

Data Integrity Checks:***
Conducted checks for unique entries to ensure data integrity before analysis.

***Exploratory Data Analysis***
The exploratory analysis involved several SQL queries to extract insights:

Income Distribution by State:***
Analyzed average household income by state, identifying states with the highest and lowest average incomes.

Type of Area Analysis:***
Explored income levels based on the type of area (e.g., urban, suburban), revealing economic disparities.

City-Level Income Insights:***
Examined average incomes at the city level within states, highlighting cities with significant wealth.

Aggregation of Land and Water Areas:***
